# Comp-Comm Structure

Due to the multiple technological components of the band, Comp-Comm is divided into two sub-committees, for increased reliability and speed in implementing features or fixing bugs.

## HACK

HACK is the sub-committee right below the Computer Coordinator in the hierarchy of Comp-Comm. People in this committee need to be reliable workers that can work on anything that needs to get done. HACK will also be in charge of delegating responsibility to the rest of Comp-Comm (see below), if there is work that needs to be delegated.

### Qualifications

Some qualifications include:

- Programming knowledge at least the level of CS 61A
- Fast communication, reliable in responses
- Finish tasks at a reasonable, reliable rate
- Bonus points for previously being a Computer Assistant

To join HACK, you'll also need to write a letter to the Computer Coordinator and the PRD and sign up for an interview.

## Computer Assistant (CA)

Computer Assistants are the members of the rest of Comp-Comm. Normally, they can just peruse the Issues page of any Comp-Comm repository on Github and work on anything that needs to get done. Sometimes, the Computer Coordinator or members of HACK might delegate work to certain CA's, if there is work that needs to be delegated.

### Qualifications

The only qualifications needed to join Comp-Comm as a CA is being willing to learn and work responsibly. There will be workshops in the spring, so anyone can join CA and help out regardless of prior experience. To write for this committee, write a short email to the Computer Coordinator and the PRD expressing interest to join Comp-Comm and whether or not you'll need to be hooked up with a Github/Slack account.
